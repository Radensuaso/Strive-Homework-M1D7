          Meet Pixel 4a, the Google phone at a helpful price. It comes packed
          with the things that you want most in a phone, and all the helpful
          experiences that you expect from Google. You can take great photos, in
          any light – even capture the Milky Way. (Yes, that Milky Way.) It has
          an Adaptive Battery that lasts up to 24 hours, while Pixel’s custom
          Titan M chip keeps your data secure. And with the new Google
          Assistant, you get the help that you need, fast. Pixel 4a comes with
          all this and more, for a lot less than you’d expect. The Pixel 4a
          camera has the same features that Pixel is known for, like Live HDR+,
          dual exposure controls, Night Sight and Super Res Zoom. Pixel’s
          battery lasts up to 24 hours. It adapts to the way you use your
          favourite apps and reduces power to the ones you rarely use. So you
          can swipe and stream to your heart’s content. Let your Pixel help out
          with the small things, so you can do more of what you love. It has the
          new Google Assistant to help you to control your phone, send texts and
          even search within apps. It also has the exclusive Recorder app, which
          automatically transcribes speech and lets you search across your audio
          recordings. Get peace of mind knowing that your phone is working to
          keep you and your things safe. Pixel 4a is protected by the Titan M
          security chip and receives guaranteed updates for at least three
          years. It also has Google’s Personal Safety app. It helps you to reach
          the emergency services and can even detect if you’ve been in an
          accident

          Discover the smartphone camera to end all cameras. An Android phone
          with an awe-inspiring 108 MP Wide Camera, 40 MP Front Camera and 48 MP
          Telephoto Camera, Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G eclipses any Samsung mobile
          phone before it. That’s an Android smartphone with millions more
          pixels for impossibly sharp shots that you can crop and print –
          without losing detail. Featuring Single Take, allowing you to shoot
          for up to 10 seconds and get back a variety of formats – meaning you
          can choose the best style for the moment without having to reshoot.
          The most powerful selfie camera on a Galaxy phone yet. Galaxy S20
          Ultra 5G’s 40 MP camera gives you pro-grade tech and shifts to 10 MP
          with large pixels for crisp low light selfies. A SIM free smart phone
          with Samsung’s most advanced zoom yet is a hybrid optical zoom that
          produces a monumental 100x Space Zoom. Now no snap will ever be out of
          reach. Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G is now the highest-resolution video
          on a smartphone. 8K video revolutionises how you capture photos and
          videos, taking mobile resolution from 4K all the way to 8K. That’s 4
          times bigger than UHD and 16 times bigger than FHD. You can even pull
          33 MP stills right out of 8K video. With a 5G modem baked in, Galaxy
          S20 Ultra 5G lets you upload and download in an instant.¹ That means
          livestreaming, sharing and gaming at 5G speeds. Samsung Galaxy S20
          Ultra 5G batteries are powerful, maxing out at 5,000 mAh (typical)².
          They’re also intelligent, adjusting to your mobile habits to save
          power and last longer on a single charge. Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G storage
          can be expanded with a microSD card for even more storage – up to 1.5
          TB total.³ (¹ Requires 5G network connection. ² Typical value tested
          under third-party laboratory conditions. Rated (minimum) capacity is
          4,855 mAh. ³ MicroSD card sold separately.)
